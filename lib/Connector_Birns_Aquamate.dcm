D Tiny Connector (TC): BIRNS Aquamate Connectors are excellent for medium power or signal use, or when weight and/or mechanical abuse are considerations. This rugged series is molded of high-insulation neoprene that may be mated while wet or underwater. Aquamate connectors are also suitable for most non-magnetic requirements. Circular and Low Profile formats are available, as are our Mini-Connector and Flat (FL) and FAWL designs. Male and female connectors are available in bulkhead and in-line configurations. Heat-treated beryllium copper sockets, gold plating, and stainless steel bodï»¿ies are standard; options include water-blocking and locking sleeves of durable Delrin or heavy-duty Stainless Steel.
